// sizeof() on an array will return its size in memory,
// while sizeof on the first element returns the size of THAT element.
// sizeof({0,1,2}) returns the same value as 3*sizeof(int). 
// Because there are three 'int's in the array.
// Now apply the assignment as an equation: 12*sizeof(int)/sizeof(int)
// The answer? 12. - Because a/a = 1 and in this case the sizeof(int) is the 'a'
